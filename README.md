Realtime human detector system using Opencv3 and Python 

Requirements:
1.Python=3.5
2.Opencv3
3.imutils (pip imutils)

The script includes SVM detector for human body and Haar Casscade for Body,face and eyes detector.
Either use your own video file or use the realtime webcame, change the line 9 for that.

Total 3 windows, 1 with only SVM detector, 1 with SVM and Haar Cascade, last with Background Reduction

Still working system, future plans include better speed and higher accuracy
